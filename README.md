# MIT 6.684 Labs
The lab assignments of [MIT 6.684 Course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/), implemented in Rust.

The course is on Distributed systems and goes into detail of designing fault-tolerant, distributed,
highly available systems.

It uses Go in the labs, however I wanted to do the same labs in Rust.
